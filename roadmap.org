* DONE Use Methodtables
* DONE Create bullets

* DONE Rooms larger than screen (camera)
* BLOCKED Sound (Implemented, need to find real sounds)
* BLOCKED Actual art (Have to find an artist)
* TODO GUNS
** Machine Gun (standard)
Movement implemented now.
** Flamethrower
A force rather than an impulse, constant power, overheats?
** Mines
Set a mine down, massive blast after about 2 seconds.
** Lasers?
No motion imparted by a shot, but if the shot hits you it imparts motion; can be ricocheted
to hit yourself and move you, or power things.
** Chainsaw
Moves quickly, tears through enemies, actually controls "normally"
** Bomb?
Big strong blast first, then you can bounce it back on yourself for a second.
** Hookshot
* TODO AI
* TODO UI (Write my own or find an existing one.)
  Maybe look into [https://github.com/vurtun/gui]
* TODO Menus (Requires UI)
* TODO Physfs?
* TODO Cutscenes?
* TODO Story mode?
* TODO OpenGL rewrite? (shaders and prettiness)
  Aside from the fact that I'd be using OpenGL it shouldn't be incredibly painful.
  At this point behavior and drawing are fairly decoupled already; chipmunks coords
  map better to OpenGL anyway;
